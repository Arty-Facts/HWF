## Python script that sends serialized data to the server 
(basically representing the role of a user since we don't have that API yet)

Just run transportTest.py with the hub and client.js (or the daemon if handling of flatbuffers is implemented yet) started and pray it works
#### (Don't forget to grab the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root folder first, else it won't work)
